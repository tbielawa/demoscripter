Service Now Chg Record Creator (Tblabla)
We committed to automatiically creating CHG via API
3 youtube tutorials later we figured out how
created "import set table" transformation maps
imported 1 record from CSV-Vicotry
tried to reproduce w/ Rest API & 1 new chg record
800, 1200, 17000, 28000 around 50000 failed record import realized we sent SN QA into infinite loop
Met/Meeting with Service Now team to review our integration
Results

Misc Closing (turtle)
Func workers hw running on a dedicated system
No more charged func nushus host
Dockerize Monog/rabbit
same level portability as recore/rerest/reworker(Deployment consitent)
better utilization of AWS resources $376 per month
